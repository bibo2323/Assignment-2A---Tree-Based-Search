"""DFS and BFS (uninformed). Owner: Shirleen Teo Shu Enn

bfs() below is a WORKING EXAMPLE showing the pattern. Copy its style for dfs().
Tie-breaking: problem.expand() already returns children in ascending node order.
BFS = queue (first in, first out).  DFS = stack (last in, first out), so for DFS
you must push children in REVERSE order to expand the smallest node first.
